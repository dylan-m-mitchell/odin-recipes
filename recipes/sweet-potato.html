    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sweet Potato</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups peeled, cubed sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pecan Topping</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li> To prepare the sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium 
            saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until 
            tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. </li>
        <li> Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until 
            well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix 
            until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li> To make the topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a 
            medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is 
            coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle 
            topping over sweet potato mixture. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 
            about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Serve and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
