 <h2>Best green bean casserole</h2>
 <p> A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, 
    and this version can be on the table in no time at all thanks to 
    just four ingredients from your pantry or fridge: canned green beans, 
    condensed mushroom soup, 
    French-fried onions, and shredded Cheddar cheese. </p>
    <p>This green bean casserole is truly the best. 
        Made with just four budget-friendly ingredients, you'll 
        come back to this green bean casserole recipe year after year.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two drained cans of green beans.</li>
        <li>A can of condensed cream of mushroom soup.</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>French-fried onion topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Ingredients: </strong>Crumbled bacon, 
            saut√©ed mushrooms or onions, garlic, Parmesan cheese, 
            black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix the beans and soup in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until warm</li>
        <li>Stir in half the cheese. Microwave until melted and well-blended.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a prepared baking dish. Top with fried onions and remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the onions are brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, this 
        canned green bean casserole should be perfectly cooked in
         about 10 minutes. Of course, that doesn't include the 5-8 minutes 
         the ingredients spend in the microwave! </p>
